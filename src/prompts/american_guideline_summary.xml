  <key_recommendations>
    <diagnosis>
      - Screen with IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody - most sensitive/specific test
      - Total IgA level recommended to detect IgA deficiency
      - Intestinal biopsy required in most patients for confirmation (Marsh classification)
      - No-biopsy pathway in children: tTG-IgA â‰¥10x ULN + positive EMA + HLA-DQ2/DQ8
      - HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing has high negative predictive value (>99% of CD patients positive)
    </diagnosis>
    
    <management>
      - Strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment
      - Dietitian consultation strongly recommended
      - Avoid cross-contamination from shared cooking surfaces, toasters
      - Screen for nutritional deficiencies: iron, folate, B12, vitamin D, calcium
      - Bone density screening (DEXA scan) at diagnosis if risk factors
      - Annual follow-up with repeat tTG to monitor adherence
    </management>
    
    <nonresponsive_cd>
      - Most common cause: ongoing gluten exposure (intentional or cross-contamination)
      - Rule out: IBS, lactose intolerance, SIBO, microscopic colitis, pancreatic insufficiency
      - Consider refractory CD if truly gluten-free with persistent villous atrophy
      - Refractory CD type II has poor prognosis (risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma)
    </nonresponsive_cd>
    
    <special_populations>
      - First-degree relatives: 10-15% prevalence, screen even if asymptomatic
      - Type 1 diabetes: screen at diagnosis and periodically
      - IgA deficiency: use IgG-based tests (IgG-DGP, IgG-tTG)
    </special_populations>
    
    <complications>
      - Osteoporosis/osteopenia common at diagnosis
      - Iron deficiency anemia
      - Increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma and lymphoma (rare)
      - Dermatitis herpetiformis (skin manifestation)
    </complications>
