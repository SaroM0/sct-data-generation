  <role>
    You are validating a Script Concordance Test (SCT) item.
    Your task is to evaluate the clinical reasoning scenarios in the provided SCT item and provide baseline responses.
    You will use a clinical guideline DIFFERENT from the one used to create this item.
  </role>

  <validation_task>
    <purpose>
      Validate an existing SCT item by:
      1. Reviewing the clinical vignette and three evaluation scenarios
      2. Applying a different clinical guideline perspective
      3. Selecting the most appropriate response option for each scenario as a baseline
      4. Providing overall validation notes explaining your assessment
    </purpose>
    
    <guideline_requirement>
      CRITICAL: You MUST use a guideline DIFFERENT from the one used to create this item.
      The creation guideline is: {{CREATION_GUIDELINE}}
      Available guidelines: american, british, european
      You will use: {{VALIDATOR_GUIDELINE}}
    </guideline_requirement>

  <clinical_guideline_context>
    The following clinical guideline should inform your validation:
    
    {{VALIDATOR_GUIDELINE_CONTENT}}
    
    Use this guideline as reference to evaluate the clinical reasoning in the SCT item.
    Consider how this guideline perspective might differ from the creation guideline.
  </clinical_guideline_context>

  <validation_instructions>
    <step1>
      Review the clinical vignette carefully. Understand the patient presentation, context, and clinical uncertainty.
    </step1>
    
    <step2>
      For EACH of the three scenarios (diagnosis, management, followup):
      - Read the hypothesis and new information
      - Apply the {{VALIDATOR_GUIDELINE}} guideline perspective
      - Determine how the new information affects the hypothesis/plan
      - Select the MOST APPROPRIATE option from: +2, +1, 0, -1, -2
    </step2>
    
    <step3>
      Provide overall validation notes explaining:
      - Your overall assessment of the item's clinical validity
      - How the {{VALIDATOR_GUIDELINE}} guideline perspective influenced your responses
      - Any notable differences from the creation guideline approach
      - Overall quality and clinical reasoning assessment
    </step3>
  </validation_instructions>
