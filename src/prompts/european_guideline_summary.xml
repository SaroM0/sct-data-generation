  <key_recommendations>
    <diagnosis>
      - IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibody is first-line test
      - Total IgA to detect selective IgA deficiency
      - No-biopsy approach for children: tTG-IgA â‰¥10x ULN + positive EMA in second sample + HLA-DQ2/DQ8 + symptomatic
      - Adults and asymptomatic children: biopsy required
      - Marsh-Oberhuber classification for histology
    </diagnosis>
    
    <management>
      - Strict gluten-free diet for life
      - Expert dietitian consultation essential
      - Annual follow-up with clinical assessment and serology
      - Monitor: growth (children), weight, symptoms, quality of life
      - Screen for deficiencies: iron, folic acid, B12, vitamin D, zinc
      - Bone densitometry if risk factors present
    </management>
    
    <nonresponsive_cd>
      - Main cause: continuing gluten intake (intentional or inadvertent)
      - Exclude: lactose intolerance, SIBO, microscopic colitis, IBS
      - Persistent villous atrophy on GFD: refractory CD (rare)
      - Type I refractory CD: normal intraepithelial lymphocytes
      - Type II refractory CD: abnormal intraepithelial lymphocytes, risk of lymphoma
    </nonresponsive_cd>
    
    <special_considerations>
      - Screening in: first-degree relatives, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune conditions
      - IgA deficiency: use IgG-based tests (IgG-DGP, IgG-tTG)
      - Dermatitis herpetiformis: skin biopsy confirmatory, responds to GFD
    </special_considerations>
    
    <complications>
      - Osteopenia/osteoporosis
      - Anemia (iron, folate deficiency)
      - Hyposplenism
      - Increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders if untreated
      - Reproductive issues in untreated patients
    </complications>
