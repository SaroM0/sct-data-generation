## ABSTRACT
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA—for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss. Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.
IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease— with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.
an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality—high, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).

developed in accordance with the BSG guideline process (revised version 2018) and the Agree II instrument.
A committee of 13 members was convened from interested individuals representing a range of disciplines including gastroenterology, haematology, specialist nursing and patient groups, under the co-chairmanship of AFG and NB. Two lay members on the Guideline Committee represented patients and the general public. Following discussion of the scope and purpose of the guidelines and the key issues, a formal literature search was undertaken by the National Guidelines Centre using all subcategories of the term &quot;iron deficiency anaemia&quot;. Leads were identified to oversee the writing of section drafts based on a review of the relevant literature, and to produce draft sets of recommendations relevant to each section: Definitions—WT; Initial assessment—JS; Coeliac disease and further evaluation—RS; Treatment—ILPB; Special situations—MP, NB, AFG; Service considerations—RL. JS led on collating the consensus statements and editing the section drafts into a unified guideline document.
These recommendations were subject to three rounds of anonymised consensus voting by the full committee in an eDelphi exercise during 2020 using an online platform (ECD Solutions, Columbus, USA). Recommendations were modified in the light of feedback from previous rounds, and those reaching a consensus of over 80% were incorporated into the final document.
For each statement, section leads provided a grading of the quality of the supporting evidence, and the strength of the recommendation—these assessments were all ratified by the co-chairs. The quality of the supporting evidence was semi-quantified using the GRADE system (high, moderate, low, very low). The recommendation strength (strong, weak) was based on the evidence quality, but as in many cases this was low or very low, a range of other factors were considered including (as appropriate) the degree of consensus, the perceived risk/benefit balance, patient views, resource costs and expert opinion.
Information regarding evidence quality, eDelphi consensus and recommendation strength is summarised for each statement in the executive summary. The final document was read and approved by all members of the guideline committee, and formally assessed and approved by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee of the BSG.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias and Hb E—and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.
A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective and difficult to justify in most cases.
## Functional iron deficiency
Absolute iron deficiency describes a situation where body iron stores are inadequate to meet demands, while in FID the supply of iron for erythropoiesis is inadequate despite apparently normal iron stores in cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. This restrictive effect is modulated by hepcidin, which also limits iron absorption through the gut mucosa.
A common clinical setting for FID is CKD, where parenteral iron therapy facilitates the response to administered erythropoietin to correct anaemia. FID is also one element of the anaemia of chronic disease, occurring in many chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and IBD. A detailed discussion of the complex pathogenesis of the anaemia of chronic disease is beyond the scope of these guidelines.
An area of difficulty is establishing whether patients with presumed FID (with raised inflammatory markers and an SF in the normal range) have reduced iron stores indicative of absolute deficiency. When attributing anaemia to FID, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient evidence of a chronic illness. Evidence from studies in CKD suggests that in the absence of thalassaemia, the percentage of hypochromic red cells and Retic-Hb are superior to transferrin saturation in predicting the response to intravenous iron therapy. A transferrin saturation of &lt;20% is indicative of iron restriction, particularly in thalassaemia carriers.
Similar evidence that low Retic-Hb is an independent marker of iron restriction in the non-CKD setting,&lt;sup&gt;42–44&lt;/sup&gt; and for example provides a reliable marker of iron stores in patients with IBD. A very low hepcidin level is more commonly seen in absolute than FID, and may therefore indicate the probability of a response to oral IRT, but few UK laboratories offer this test. A good haematological response to a trial of oral iron suggests absolute iron deficiency rather than FID.
Given that chronic inflammatory conditions are common and that SF values may therefore be difficult to interpret, it is important to use additional clinical and laboratory information when considering whether further GI investigations are warranted. Clinical features (eg, bowel-related symptoms), inflammatory markers (eg C-reactive protein (CRP)), transferrin saturation, red cell hypochromia and response to oral IRT can all be helpful in this complex clinical setting.
## Non-anaemic iron deficiency
The development of anaemia from iron deficiency goes through an initial phase where body iron stores are depleted resulting in hypoferritinaemia, but the Hb concentration is still within the normal range (non-anaemic iron deficiency (NAID)). For example, in a study of young women with menorrhagia, over half had reduced iron stores but only 25% were actually anaemic.
The overall prevalence of significant underlying GI pathology, and in particular of GI malignancy, is low in NAID. In the absence of other pointers, GI investigation generally is not warranted in premenopausal women since the cause is likely to be menstrual blood loss and/or recent pregnancy (see the Special situations section). The threshold for investigation of NAID should however be low in men, postmenopausal women, and those with GI symptoms or a family history of GI pathology.

and on occasion more specifically of iron deficiency (such as angular stomatitis, glossitis, koilonychia, restless legs syndrome, pagophagia (a craving for ice), blue sclerae). A personal or family background of GI disease may provide a clue as to the cause of IDA. A family history of true iron-refractory IDA is rare, but if given may suggest a genetic disturbance of the pathway controlling iron absorption.
Even if present, abdominal symptoms are not a reliable guide to the presence, nature or location of underlying GI pathology. Physical examination is generally unremarkable, but may on occasion provide the diagnosis, for example, in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.
There are many potential contributors to a negative iron balance, leading to IDA (see table 1). Particular risk factors that should be sought include chronic overt blood loss (eg, nosebleeds, menstruation), blood donation, inadequate dietary intake, long-term NSAID usage and previous resectional or bypass surgery of the GI tract. More recently it has been recognised that long-term proton pump inhibitor(PPI) therapy may contribute to the risk of iron deficiency, presumably as a result of impaired absorption secondary to hypochlorhydria, and that IDA is common in endurance athletes—the mechanism is uncertain, but high hepcidin levels may contribute. Iron deficiency is however often multifactorial, and so the presence of one or more of these risk factors should not necessarily be a deterrent to further GI investigation, particularly in older age groups.
There is a limited place for contrast CT without bowel preparation in those with IDA and major comorbidities including frailty, accepting that this will only identify relatively gross pathology, and will miss some cancers. The value of investigating those where the outcome is unlikely to affect management does however need to be carefully considered (see the Special situations section). There is no longer a role for contrast fluoroscopy in the investigation of the upper and lower GI tract in IDA.
Atrophic gastritis is a recognised contributor to the development of IDA, probably because of the impairment of iron absorption that accompanies all causes of achlorhydria. In support of this, subgroup analysis of a small study has suggested that atrophic gastritis may be commoner in those without a definite alternative explanation for IDA than in those with. Helicobacter infection has also been weakly associated with the risk of developing IDA, though it is unclear whether this reflects the effect of related pathologies such as peptic ulceration or atrophic gastritis. The same meta-analysis suggested that Helicobacter eradication does not improve the Hb response to IRT. It, therefore, remains to be established whether the cost of routine gastric biopsies in IDA is justified, given that the results are unlikely to directly alter management.
### Preliminary investigations
CD is a relatively common cause of IDA and should be routinely excluded in all age groups (see the later section). Renal tract pathology, in particular renal cell carcinoma, is a well-recognised though uncommon cause of IDA due to chronic blood loss, and so all subjects presenting with unexplained IDA should at least be checked for microscopic haematuria. Urine dipstick testing and mid-stream urine (MSU) analysis have limited sensitivity and specificity for renal tract pathology, but nevertheless, after exclusion of infection, a persisting positive result is an indication for urological investigation.
### Imaging of the GI tract
### How to investigate
Standard practice is to examine the upper and lower GI tracts at gastroscopy and colonoscopy respectively, and many units undertake both procedures at the same session. This approach is more efficient than separate procedures and, given the patient is already prepared, simplifies the decision to proceed to colonoscopy if there are abnormalities of uncertain relevance to IDA in the upper GI tract. Given that most series have revealed some cases with dual unrelated pathology, the recommendation is to defer colonoscopy only if an upper GI cancer is found. Overall, investigation of the GI tract in IDA reveals potentially significant pathology in about a third of cases—there is a myriad of recognised GI causes, as outlined in table 1.
CT colonography is an acceptable alternative to colonoscopy, and may be preferable in certain clinical situations, such as in the presence of major comorbidities. The advantage of CT colonography is that it is less invasive, does not require sedation and provides limited imaging of the other viscera. The disadvantage is that it does not identify more subtle mucosal pathology such as vascular malformations, and there may be some circumstances where a colonoscopy is subsequently required to obtain histology, remove a polyp, or insert a tattoo prior to laparoscopic resection.
### Who to investigate
The investigation of IDA potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases—and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.
It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do on occasion develop cancer in the GI tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women—particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).
There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables—specifically age, sex, MCV and Hb concentration. The IDIOM App has been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process with the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.
### Role of faecal immunochemical testing
The introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) for trace quantities of blood in the stool has provided a major step forward in risk stratification for those presenting with clinical features that are potentially due to colorectal cancer (CRC), and the value of it has been demonstrated in a series of large observational studies.&lt;sup&gt;64–69&lt;/sup&gt; FIT is currently recommended by NICE for determining whether IDA in the under-60 age group warrants fast-track referral –while this suggestion is logical, the evidence base is limited.

FIT, faecal immunochemical testing; IDA, iron deficiency anaemia.
Currently therefore we are unable to advocate the use of FIT for risk stratification or colorectal cancer exclusion in IDA, though this view may change with the appearance of a stronger evidence base. While it seems logical to consider the result of FIT in the overall assessment of the risk serious organic disease, safety netting is still required to ensure that serious pathology is not missed. BSG guidance will be updated as further evidence for the role of FIT in IDA is evaluated, and a BSG Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) guidelines group has recently been commissioned to assess this.
## COELIAC DISEASE AND IDA
CD is found in 3%–5% of subjects investigated for unexplained IDA as demonstrated by studies from the UK, Europe, USA and Middle East. Duodenal biopsy histology remains the gold standard for exclusion or confirmation of the diagnosis. Coeliac serology—anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or antiendomysial antibody—is however a useful screening test. A prospective study of 2000 referrals for gastroscopy (all indications including anaemia, mean age 56 years) with parallel serology and histology yielded both a sensitivity and a specificity of tTG IgA antibody for CD of 90.9%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6%.
With emerging evidence on the reliability of serology with an anti-tTG IgA titre of greater than 10× the upper limit of normal, the BSG has issued interim guidance on a 'no biopsy' protocol in patients under the age of 50 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided they have no alarm symptoms. An updated guideline on the diagnosis of CD in adults is expected in 2022.
Retrospective studies suggest that antibody-negative CD accounts for about 2% of the total coeliac population,
though this may be an under-estimate due to ascertainment bias (seronegative subjects are less likely to get a biopsy), and the true figure may be nearer 10%. As standard serological screening tests are IgA-based, apparently seronegative CD can result from IgA deficiency. This only accounts for a minority of antibody-negative cases however, and screening for it may not be cost-effective as the result only marginally changes the probability of CD.
As the relative prevalence of seronegative CD is highest in the elderly, the sensitivity of coeliac serology for CD falls with age. This has importance in the investigation of IDA, where the incidence is highest in the elderly, and the median age at presentation is over 70. As the sensitivity of serology for CD can be as low as 74% in coeliacs presenting with IDA, it may be that an age-related approach to investigation is most appropriate.
In a younger patient with IDA, where the sensitivity of serology for CD is high and the risk of other serious pathology low, a check on coeliac serology may be all that is required, with gastroscopy and biopsy only if the result is positive. Other factors of course may influence the need for further investigation—colonoscopy, for example, should be considered in those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer.
In an older subject with IDA, the sensitivity of serology for CD is rather lower, while the probability of other pathology and in particular GI malignancy, is much higher, and dual pathology is more common. So a more appropriate approach in this situation might be bidirectional endoscopy (BDE) with duodenal biopsy to exclude CD.
## FOLLOW-UP AND RECURRENT IDA
**12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality—low, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).**
**16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality—low, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).**
**23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality—very low, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).**
IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable,&lt;sup&gt;4 32 51 85–88&lt;/sup&gt; and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.
Depending on the circumstances, further investigation may involve repeat BDE, particularly if the original procedures were felt to have provided inadequate views or to be outdated. Detailed imaging of the small bowel is an important element of further assessment (see the Small bowel section). Finally, formal imaging of the renal tract should be considered regardless of the result of testing for microscopic haematuria, in view of the recognised association of renal cell carcinoma with IDA.
Depending on the definition employed, IDA proves to be recurrent in the medium term in 12%–25% of cases following previous negative BDE and a complete response to IRT. Recurrent IDA will respond in most cases respond to further IRT.
There are no established algorithms for the investigation of recurrent IDA, but our recommendation is to follow the principles outlined earlier. In particular, repeat BDE is advised if the previous investigations are outdated. There is no validated definition of this, but a threshold of 2 years has been suggested on the basis of limited evidence.
The diagnostic yield of small bowel examination by capsule endoscopy (CE) is high in recurrent IDA unexplained by adequate imaging of the upper and lower GI tract (see the Small bowel section). The most common findings are vascular malformations (sometimes single but more commonly multiple) and Crohn's disease, though tumours account for a small percentage of cases.
The prevalence depends on definitions, but in a significant minority of cases of recurrent IDA, no convincing cause is found despite comprehensive investigation of the GI and renal tracts. Long-term IRT is an appropriate management strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or where it is irreversible, for example, secondary to atrophic gastritis or previous GI surgery.
66.6% (95% CI 61% to 72%) has been reported in a systematic review of CE in IDA. Angioectasia, Crohn's disease and NSAID enteropathy are common findings,&lt;sup&gt;17 89 94–96&lt;/sup&gt; and factors such as transfusion dependence, increasing age and comorbidity all positively influence the diagnostic yield. A longer small bowel transit time on CE is also associated with a higher yield, so the possibility of missed pathology should be considered when transit is unduly rapid.
The pathology found on CE is actually within reach of standard gastroscopy in up to 28% of cases. Such lesions include in particular Cameron's ulcers, gastric antral vascular ectasia and vascular anomalies high on the lesser curve. Repeating gastroscopy prior to CE in all patients is not cost-effective, but should be considered on an individual case basis, particularly if views were previously poor or there has been a major time lapse since the last gastroscopy. Similarly, lesions may be missed in the right colon, particularly in the elderly and when preparation has been suboptimal.
While the pick-up rate for small bowel pathology is significantly higher in the elderly, there is emerging evidence of the value of CE in younger age groups with IDA, though with differences in aetiology. A retrospective European cooperative study of 220 cases under the age of 50 revealed significant pathology in 32%, neoplastic in 5%. On multivariate analysis, a low MCV and weight loss were independent predictors of significant pathology.
The rebleeding potential is low following a negative CE, and a conservative approach can in general be followed. CE does however have a miss rate, importantly for small bowel tumours. Indications warranting additional investigation after a negative CE may include a further Hb drop of &gt;40 g/L, and a change in presentation from occult to overt bleeding. In the context of suspected small bowel bleeding including IDA, there is limited evidence to support repeating CE after an initial negative study in cases where there remains a strong suspicion of undiagnosed pathology, with a yield of up to 45%.
Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE), an endoscopic technique that allows deep intubation of the small bowel, provides the option for endoscopic biopsy and/or therapy, but this is an invasive procedure, and the need for it should be directed by the findings on CE. Predictably, the diagnostic yield of double-balloon enteroscopy is significantly higher if preceded by a positive CE than a negative one.
The majority of small bowel lesions underlying IDA are subtle vascular or inflammatory abnormalities, undetectable by conventional radiology. CT enterography (CTE) does however have a role in delineating small bowel tumours seen on CE, and the combination of arterial venous and phases is helpful in characterising vascular small bowel tumours and detecting metastases. In addition of course, CTE may reveal evidence of other neoplasia underlying IDA, such as lymphoma or tumours of the renal tract.
## FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE SMALL BOWEL
**13.** In those with negative bidirectional endoscopy of acceptable quality and either an inadequate response to IRT or recurrent IDA, we recommend further investigation of the small bowel and renal tract to exclude other causes (evidence quality—moderate, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong).
**14.** We recommend capsule endoscopy as the preferred test for examining the small bowel in IDA because it is highly sensitive for mucosal lesions. CT/MR enterography may be considered in those not suitable, and these are complementary investigations in the assessment of inflammatory and neoplastic disease of the small bowel (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
**15.** After a negative capsule endoscopy of acceptable quality, we recommend that further GI investigation needs to be considered only if there is ongoing IDA after IRT (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).
CE is now the first-line test for assessment of the small bowel in the setting of covert bleeding/IDA, as it has a higher diagnostic yield than radiology.&lt;sup&gt;90–92&lt;/sup&gt; A pooled diagnostic yield of</markdown>

inactive IBD, previous intolerance to or failure of traditional iron salts and moderate IDA (Hb &gt;95 g/L), 12 weeks of treatment with ferric maltol normalised the Hb in 63%–66% of cases. GI side effects and overall rates of treatment cessation were comparable to placebo. Due to a relatively low iron content, the rate of iron loading is comparatively slow with ferric maltol, but iron loading and tolerance were maintained during a year of active treatment, with normalisation of Hb in 89% of cases. Although more expensive than traditional iron salts, ferric maltol is considerably less expensive than parenteral irons.
Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat IDA, first because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Second, as parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful Hb response with a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should therefore be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/ or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.
There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of IRT, and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant to oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding and concurrent deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.
The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.
Logistically it may be difficult to arrange monitoring 2 weeks after starting oral IRT in all cases. Indeed because of the lower doses of iron used in alternate day regimens, a 28-day review may be more appropriate. At this point, a rise in Hb of 20 g/L or into the normal range would be accepted as an adequate response. Whichever monitoring regimen is used, intolerance and/or ineffectiveness should be managed promptly and appropriately.
For patients with intolerance or failure of Hb response at the 2–4 weeks point, alternate day traditional iron salts (if not already used) or ferric maltol may be alternatives to parenteral iron on those with mild-moderate anaemia (Hb &gt;95 g/L). The tolerability and response should be assessed, and failure of the Hb to rise by 10 g/L at 4 weeks for alternate day iron, or 6 weeks for ferric maltol, indicates the need for parenteral IRT.
Regular Hb monitoring is recommended to ensure an ultimately satisfactory response. The optimal interval is not clear, but every 4 weeks until the Hb is in the normal range seems reasonable. After normalisation of the Hb, oral iron needs to be continued to replenish the iron stores. Traditionally it has been recommended that oral iron is continued for 2–3 months to do this. However, the duration required and indeed the appropriate measure of true iron repletion are both unclear. In healthy, almost iron-replete subjects, 2 months of continued iron was considered sufficient. However, in patients with chronic disease, continuing blood loss, impaired absorption or GI inflammatory
Intermittent oral iron (defined as less frequently than daily) has been reported to be at least as effective as daily dosing in raising Hb levels in young women and during pregnancy, although less effective in boosting iron stores in the short-term. Intermittent oral iron is associated with a lower incidence of GI adverse events in pregnant women (relative risk 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84).
The optimal drug, dosage and timing of oral IRT for adults with IDA are not clearly defined, and the effect of alternate day therapy on compliance and ultimate haematological response are unclear. Based on the available literature, a once daily dose of 50–100 mg of elemental iron (eg, one ferrous sulfate 200 mg tablet a day) taken in the fasting state may be the best compromise option for initial treatment. Whatever agent and regimen are chosen, it is essential to monitor the initial haematological response, and modify as appropriate with apparent therapeutic failure.
The best option for patients with significant intolerance to oral IRT (usually GI disturbance) is also unclear. Depending on the individual, oral ferric maltol, alternate day oral iron and parenteral iron are all options. The standard practice of switching to a different traditional iron salt is not supported by evidence.

disease (where iron is lost from the GI mucosa), it is likely that a longer period would be required.
## Parenteral IRT
The intravenous route for IRT may however be preferable from the outset in those with ongoing significant bleeding, malabsorption due to GI disease, the combination of iron deficiency and anaemia of inflammation, or issues with administration (eg, severe dysphagia) or compliance. Parenteral iron may also be indicated in those failing to respond to oral IRT due to intolerance, pharmacodynamic failure or continued bleeding. Intravenous IRT has been shown to be superior to continuing oral therapy in cases with IDA that failed to show a significant Hb rise with oral IRT (defined as an increase of 10 g/L or more after 2 weeks), or had ongoing menorrhagia.
A variety of parenteral iron preparations are available in the UK (table 4), and these all have the advantage of providing a much greater iron load per dose than oral iron. They all are more expensive than traditional oral iron preparations, and there are additional associated costs relating to the facilities, staffing and equipment required for administering infusions. Some preparations (ferric carboxymaltose), iron derisomaltose (previously iron isomaltoside 1000) and (low molecular weight) iron-dextran can effectively replenish total body iron stores in one or two infusions. Iron sucrose requires multiple infusions because the maximum dose per administration is 200 mg. Iron-dextran is rarely used, as the much longer time required for infusion (4–6 hours) means this is much less convenient than the other total dose preparations, which can be given over 15–40 min.
The dose of parenteral iron may be calculated using the original Ganzoni formula. Modifications using a lower target Hb level (130 g/L) have also been used. Overall the different intravenous iron formulations appear equivalent in terms of the ultimate haematological response and safety, but the total dose preparations provide more rapid replenishment of body iron stores, usually in just one or two infusions.
Monitoring for a satisfactory Hb response after 2–4 weeks should be undertaken, and then as outlined below.
## Treatment of NAID
The efficacy of IRT for NAID (also termed isolated hypoferritinaemia) is unclear. There are limited studies in adults, with a variety of inclusion criteria and outcomes. A meta-analysis of these concluded that NAID was not significantly associated with physiological impairment assessed objectively by VO2 max or respiratory exchange ratio max (RERmax), and that IRT did not significantly improve either these parameters or maximal heart rate. There is however evidence that IRT may provide subjective improvement of fatigue, mental quality of life and subjective cognitive function in premenopausal women.&lt;sup&gt;156–160&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, given the safety of the available iron preparations, it would be reasonable to offer treatment for NAID if symptomatic.
## Monitoring after IRT
The optimal follow-up protocol after IRT remains to be established, but given the possibility of recurrent IDA indicating underlying disease, and the prevalence of persistent anaemia after IRT seen in some real-world studies, periodic monitoring is advised. Once the Hb has reached the normal range, a check blood count 3-monthly for 12 months and then 6-monthly for 2–3 years would be reasonable. Although SF is a reliable measure of total body iron stores, there are insufficient data to recommend routine ferritin monitoring.
## Safety of IRT
GI adverse effects (such as nausea, diarrhoea, constipation) are much commoner with oral preparations, and there is no convincing evidence for the superiority of any of the readily available traditional iron salts. GI side effects are significantly commoner with oral ferrous sulfate than placebo (OR 2.32 (95% CI 1.74 to 3.08)) or parenteral iron (OR 3.05 (95% CI 2.07 to 4.48)), and there is no dose–effect relationship over the range 50–400 mg of elemental iron per day. Despite the high prevalence of mild side-effects, the rates of discontinuation in clinical trials due to adverse events are relatively low (0%–24%), though higher than rates of discontinuation of parenteral iron (0%–18%). Discontinuation of oral IRT seems to be commoner in observational and population studies, with reported rates of up to 40%.
Caution is advised regarding the use of parenteral iron in the context of acute and chronic infection, although studies have consistently shown no significant increase in clinically important infective episodes associated with the use of parenteral IRT. Infection should not be regarded as a contraindication to parenteral IRT if the risk/benefit assessment favours treatment of the anaemia, though it should be withheld in those with ongoing bacteraemia.
Hypophosphataemia has been reported with all parenteral iron preparations. This seems to relate to the molecules complexed to the iron, rather than the iron itself. Rates of hypophosphataemia are higher with ferric carboxymaltose (58%) than with iron derisomaltose (4%) or iron sucrose (1%), but the clinical importance of this has not been established.

It has been suggested that patients with IBD and IDA should be monitored for recurrent iron deficiency every 3 months for at least a year after correction, and periodically thereafter. Recurrent IDA may indicate persistent intestinal inflammatory activity even in the face of clinical remission and normal inflammatory biomarkers.
## GI surgery
**36.** IDA is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery (*evidence quality—high, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong*).
**37.** In new presentations of IDA, we recommend that a history of GI or bariatric surgery should not preclude a search for other causes of IDA (*evidence quality—low, consensus—85%, statement strength—strong*).
Resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel generally predisposes to IDA. This includes the expanding population with a history of bariatric surgery, including sleeve gastrectomy. Reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption are probably the major underlying mechanisms, and therefore IDA in this situation may occur in the context of other nutritional deficiencies—in particular of vitamin B12.
The prevalence of IDA depends on the specific diagnostic criteria employed, but it is found in approximately a quarter of subjects 2 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and is markedly commoner in women, and in those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores. The figure for sleeve gastrectomy is probably lower.
Predictably, the yield of other causative lesions on BDE is lower in individuals with IDA and a history of GI surgery than in those without. Nevertheless, it is unsafe to automatically attribute IDA to previous surgery without excluding other possibilities, particularly in those at risk of underlying GI malignancy—bearing in mind that partial gastrectomy may predispose to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.
Without supplementation, the percentage prevalence of IDA tends to increase over the first 10 postoperative years. Long-term oral IRT is often effective, though because of underlying malabsorption this is not always the case, and intravenous therapy may be required.
## SERVICE CONSIDERATIONS
**38.** We recommend that all service providers should have clear points of referral and management pathways for patients with IDA (*evidence quality—low, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong*).
**39.** To ensure efficient use of resources, we recommend that IDA pathways should be delivered by a designated team led by a senior clinician (*evidence quality—low, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong*).
**40.** We recommend that service providers should aim to have an ambulatory care base for the administration of parenteral iron (*evidence quality—low, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong*).
## Organisation
IDA has a considerable impact on referrals for urgent investigation for suspected cancer and non-elective services. This is due to the prevalence of IDA in the population, difficulty in distinguishing IDA from other causes of anaemia, and in some areas the absence of a dedicated referral pathway for the management of anaemia. In many hospitals IDA is no longer the prime interest of haematology, so becoming an 'orphan' condition without clinical leadership. This can lead to duplication of services, prolonged referral pathways and inappropriate investigation.
Anaemia is common in elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities. The anaemia of chronic disease can mimic IDA, and in a study of fast-track referrals with suspected IDA, the diagnosis was confirmed in only 11% of cases. Therefore it is important to establish at an early stage that anaemia is due to iron deficiency. Fortunately, artificial intelligence or smart testing algorithms embedded within red cell laboratory analysers (reflex testing) are now available and can include specific recommendations for further management to primary care, including referral to a dedicated electronic IDA clinical assessment service which supports appropriate clinical interaction between primary and secondary care before any further investigation. Given the increasing fragmentation of care across providers, this should include a facility for interrogating electronic healthcare records for any previously documented diagnosis of IDA, and the results of prior investigations including oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and CT colonography.
For a dedicated IDA service to deliver highly effective care, the four essential components are confirmation of IDA, timely access to appropriate investigation (if not already investigated) ensuring appropriate IRT (with long-term therapy when needed) and strong clinical leadership.
IDA services can also provide an alternative pathway for patients found to have more severe anaemia, and who otherwise might have been referred for emergency hospital admission. Estimates based on data from Hospital Episode Statistics 2017 suggest that up to 97 781 patients are admitted in England each year with IDA as the primary diagnosis, which is 72% higher than in 2012. Similar increases over the same period are seen for non-elective hospital spells (days in hospital) with IDA as a secondary diagnosis.
## Costs associated with IDA
The estimated costs incurred by the NHS in the management of IDA in secondary care in England rose from £65.8 million in 2012/2013 to £90.6 million in 2017/2018. The vast majority of these costs arose from patient management—outpatient or emergency inpatient referral, and subsequent investigation—rather than from treatment of the iron deficiency. Clearly, treatment costs following the diagnosis of CD for example are very different to those associated following occult GI blood loss in patients taking anticoagulants. Few studies have analysed the investigation and management costs of IDA, but it is recognised from data collected as part of the national blood transfusion audits that costs arising from unnecessary emergency hospital admission could be substantially reduced if alternative patient referral pathways were readily available to support ambulatory care.
While most oral iron supplements are cheap, they are not always well-tolerated, often due to GI side-effects. Newer oral iron supplements are better tolerated, but more expensive (table 3). Intravenous IRT is often necessary for patients with comorbidities which impair iron absorption. While there are several studies reporting the cost-effectiveness of intravenous iron preparations in comparison to oral IRT for specific conditions such as CKD, CHF and IBD, it is the associated comorbidity which accounts for the improved cost-effectiveness of intravenous iron in these circumstances.</markdown>
