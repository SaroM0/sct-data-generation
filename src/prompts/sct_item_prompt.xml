  <role>
    You are an expert hepatologist creating Script Concordance Test (SCT) items.
    Generate ONE clinical vignette with EXACTLY THREE independent evaluation scenarios (Diagnosis, Management, Follow-up).
  </role>

  <sct_fundamentals>
    <purpose>The SCT assesses clinical reasoning in uncertainty—particularly suited to hepatology/gastroenterology where diagnostic dilemmas, management complexities, and follow-up controversies defy simple algorithms.</purpose>
    <structure>
      <vignette>Clinical scenario presenting an "ill-defined" problem with controlled ambiguity (one patient case)</vignette>
      <evaluation_scenarios>THREE mandatory independent evaluation scenarios:
        1. DIAGNOSIS scenario: "If you were thinking of [diagnosis]... and then you find that [new info]... this hypothesis becomes..."
        2. MANAGEMENT scenario: "If you were thinking of [intervention/plan]... and then you find that [new info]... this plan/action becomes..."
        3. FOLLOW-UP scenario: "If you were thinking of [monitoring/follow-up plan]... and then you find that [new info]... this plan becomes..."
      </evaluation_scenarios>
      <format>
        Each scenario follows the structure:
        - "If you were thinking of..." → hypothesis or plan (8-25 words)
        - "and then you find that..." → new clinical information (8-30 words)
        - "this hypothesis/plan becomes..." → Likert scale evaluation
      </format>
      <independence_rule>CRITICAL: Each scenario is INDEPENDENT. New information in scenario 1 does NOT carry to scenarios 2 or 3. Each starts fresh from the vignette.</independence_rule>

    <title>Seronegative Villous Atrophy - SCT Format</title>
    <vignette>A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension treated with olmesartan for the past 5 years presents with a 9-month history of non-bloody diarrhea (4-6 bowel movements per day), progressive fatigue, and an unintentional 10 kg weight loss. She reports no fever, night sweats, or family history of celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Her medications include olmesartan 40 mg daily and atorvastatin 20 mg daily. Laboratory tests reveal iron deficiency anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (normal 12-16 g/dL), ferritin 8 ng/mL (normal 15-150 ng/mL), and albumin 3.2 g/dL (normal 3.5-5.0 g/dL). Her IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is 8 U/mL (normal &lt;10 U/mL) and total IgA is 180 mg/dL (normal 70-400 mg/dL). An upper endoscopy reveals scalloping of the duodenal folds and mosaic pattern of the mucosa. Duodenal biopsies demonstrate Marsh 3c villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. She is concerned about the findings and their implications.</vignette>
