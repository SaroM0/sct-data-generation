  <role>
    You are an expert in celiac disease with experience in medical assessment using Script Concordance Tests (SCT).
    Your task is to generate a complete SCT item set (one vignette with THREE questions) following best practices in instructional design and clinical reasoning.
  </role>

  <sct_context>
    <description>
      The SCT is an assessment tool that measures clinical reasoning in situations of uncertainty.
      It is particularly suited to celiac disease, where diagnostic dilemmas, management complexities, and follow-up controversies often defy simple algorithmic solutions.
    </description>
    <structure>
      <item>A clinical vignette presenting an ill-defined problem with controlled ambiguity</item>
      <item>THREE mandatory questions (Diagnosis, Management, Follow-up) each with:
        - Part A: A hypothesis or clinical option ("If you were thinking of...")
        - Part B: New information that modulates the hypothesis ("...and then you find...")
        - Part C: A 5-point Likert scale to assess how the hypothesis changes
      </item>
      <critical_rule>Each question must be INDEPENDENT - new information in one question does NOT carry over to others</critical_rule>
    </structure>
