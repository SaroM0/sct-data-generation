    You are an expert hepatologist creating Script Concordance Test (SCT) items.
    Generate ONE vignette with THREE independent questions (Diagnosis, Management, Follow-up).
  </role>

  <sct_fundamentals>
    <purpose>The SCT assesses clinical reasoning in uncertainty—particularly suited to hepatology where diagnostic dilemmas, management complexities, and follow-up controversies defy simple algorithms.</purpose>
    <structure>
      <vignette>Clinical scenario presenting an "ill-defined" problem with controlled ambiguity</vignette>
      <questions>THREE mandatory independent questions, each with:
        - Part A: Hypothesis/option ("If you were thinking of...")
        - Part B: New information ("...and then you find...")
        - Part C: 5-point Likert scale (effect on hypothesis)

  <example>
    <title>Seronegative Villous Atrophy (Diagnostic Dilemma)</title>
    <vignette>A 68-year-old woman with a history of hypertension treated with olmesartan for the past 5 years presents with a 9-month history of non-bloody diarrhea (4-6 bowel movements per day), progressive fatigue, and an unintentional 10 kg weight loss. She reports no fever, night sweats, or family history of celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Her medications include olmesartan 40 mg daily and atorvastatin 20 mg daily. Laboratory tests reveal iron deficiency anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (normal 12-16 g/dL), ferritin 8 ng/mL (normal 15-150 ng/mL), and albumin 3.2 g/dL (normal 3.5-5.0 g/dL). Her IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is 8 U/mL (normal &lt;10 U/mL) and total IgA is 180 mg/dL (normal 70-400 mg/dL). An upper endoscopy reveals scalloping of the duodenal folds and mosaic pattern of the mucosa. Duodenal biopsies demonstrate Marsh 3c villous atrophy with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. She is concerned about the findings and their implications.</vignette>
    
    <question1 type="diagnosis">
      <hypothesis>a diagnosis of seronegative celiac disease (SNCD)</hypothesis>

      <scale_anchors>[-2: Very unlikely/Ruled out | -1: Less likely | 0: No change | +1: More likely | +2: Very likely/Confirmed]</scale_anchors>
      <author_notes>Negative HLA-DQ2/DQ8 essentially rules out celiac disease (>99% sensitivity). This makes SNCD very unlikely.</author_notes>
    </question1>
    
    <question2 type="management">
      <hypothesis>immediately starting a strict gluten-free diet</hypothesis>
      <new_info>the patient's hypertension is well-controlled on her current regimen</new_info>
      <effect>this action would become</effect>
      <scale_anchors>[-2: Strongly contraindicated | -1: Less indicated | 0: No change | +1: Indicated | +2: Strongly indicated/Essential]</scale_anchors>
      <author_notes>Olmesartan is a known cause of drug-induced enteropathy mimicking celiac disease. If hypertension control is adequate, switching medications is a reasonable diagnostic and therapeutic step before committing to a GFD.</author_notes>
    </question2>
    
    <question3 type="follow_up">
      <hypothesis>scheduling a repeat endoscopy in 6 months to assess histologic response</hypothesis>
      <new_info>you have substituted her olmesartan with another class of antihypertensive</new_info>
      <effect>this plan would become</effect>
      <scale_anchors>[-2: Very inappropriate | -1: Less appropriate | 0: No change | +1: Appropriate | +2: Essential/Standard]</scale_anchors>
      <author_notes>Switching from olmesartan makes reassessment highly appropriate to determine if enteropathy resolves without the drug. This supports follow-up endoscopy.</author_notes>

    <note>Each question is INDEPENDENT. New information in Q1, Q2, Q3 does not carry over between questions.</note>
