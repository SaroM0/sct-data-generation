{# SCT Item Generation Prompt Template #}
You are an expert in clinical hepatology with experience in medical assessment using Script Concordance Tests (SCT).

Your task is to generate a complete SCT item following best practices in instructional design and clinical reasoning.

## SCT CONTEXT

The SCT is an assessment tool that measures clinical reasoning in situations of uncertainty.
Each item presents:
1. A clinical vignette with controlled ambiguity
2. A diagnostic/therapeutic/test hypothesis
3. New information that modulates that hypothesis
4. A 5-point Likert scale to assess the probability change

## QUALITY CRITERIA BY FIELD

### domain
- Single clinical category for the item (subdomain)
- In hepatology: Cirrhosis_Complications, Biliary_Cholangitis, Viral_Autoimmune_Toxic_Hepatitis, NAFLD_NASH, Masses_HCC, Transplant
- Ensures balanced coverage of the curriculum
- ONLY ONE subdomain per item (do not mix)

### vignette
- Brief clinical case: 70-120 words
- Structure: [profile] [context] [symptoms/signs] [initial labs/imaging] [relevant points]
- Plausible values (AST/ALT, INR, bilirubin, platelets, ALP, GGT, MELD)
- Controlled ambiguity: reasonable differentials
- Avoid deterministic clues ("pathognomonic", "without doubt", "always")
- Clarity > technical jargon

### hypothesis
- Single, clear and specific proposition
- **CRITICAL: Must be 8-25 words in length (count carefully!)**
- Types: diagnostic, test utility, or management
- Affirmative statement, no double ideas
- Examples: "The clinical picture is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requiring immediate antibiotic therapy" (13 words), "Ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is useful at this point in the diagnostic workup" (13 words)
- Avoid "and/or", two diagnoses in one sentence, moral judgments
- If your hypothesis is too short, add relevant clinical context or specificity

### new_information
- Additional data that modulates the hypothesis (result, imaging, evolution)
- Relevant, NOT redundant with the vignette
- NOT deterministic ("Goldilocks zone": moves the needle but not obvious)
- Examples: PMN ascites 320/µL, ALT/AST >1000 after hypotension
- Avoid: repeating data, contradictory information, definitive "spoilers"

### question
- Standard fixed text for uniformity
- ALWAYS use: "How does the probability of the hypothesis change?"
- Reduces writing biases between items

### options
- EXACT 5-point Likert scale: ["+2", "+1", "0", "-1", "-2"]
- Maintain exact order and labels
- Meaning: +2 = increases a lot, +1 = increases, 0 = no change, -1 = decreases, -2 = decreases a lot

### author_notes
- Brief internal note (NOT shown to panel)
- **CRITICAL: Maximum 3 sentences (count periods carefully!)**
- Content: clinical rationale + expected effect in 1-3 sentences
- Keep it concise: avoid conjunctions that create multiple clauses
- Example: "PMN ≥250 supports SBP and should shift towards +2/+1. Some experts might mark +1 if considering alternative diagnoses." (2 sentences)
- No "correct answer" or explicit keys

## ANTIPATTERNS TO AVOID

 Deterministic vignette + obvious new_info → unanimity
 Double or ambiguous hypothesis ("SBP or cholangitis")
 **Hypothesis too short (<8 words) or too long (>25 words)**
 Repeated or inconsistent new information
 Altered options (order, number)
 **Author_notes with more than 3 sentences**
 Author_notes with explicit "key/solution"

## YOUR TASK

Generate a complete SCT item in English about hepatology that meets ALL the above criteria.

{% if topic %}
**Specific topic**: {{ topic }}
{% endif %}

{% if domain %}
**Required domain**: {{ domain }}
{% endif %}

{% if difficulty %}
**Difficulty level**: {{ difficulty }}
{% endif %}

{% if additional_context %}
**Additional context**: {{ additional_context }}
{% endif %}

Generate the complete SCT item following the structured JSON format with all required fields.

**CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS** (must pass all checks):
- Vignette: 70-120 words
- Hypothesis: 8-25 words (count carefully before submitting)
- New information: 8-30 words
- Author notes: Maximum 3 sentences (count periods carefully)
- Options: Exactly ["+2", "+1", "0", "-1", "-2"] in that order

Double-check word counts and sentence counts before generating the final output.
